# Horiseon Website Code Refactoring

## Project Description

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon website homepage. The aim is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensible and accessible.  The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code.

Below is a summary of the changes that have been made to both the HTML and CSS files. 

* Non Semantic Elements such as 'div' replaced with semantic HTML elements such as 'header','nav', 'section', 'aside' and 'footer' to aid long term sustainability.

* Alt text added to all images to improve accessibility. 

* Descriptice Title added to potentially increase web traffic.

* Em-dash punctuation used to improve user readibility.

* Consolidation of selectors which use the same formatting styles to make the code more efficient.

* Improved Logical structure of the CSS file to coincide with HTML file. E.g. Main information section preceded the Aside Section.

* Comments added throughout the HTML and CSS file.

## Usage

The Navigation bars at the top right corner of the website allow a user to navigate through the site to each section they would like to read.
